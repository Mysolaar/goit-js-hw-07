# About

Task 1:
- imports an array of gallery items from a separate file and then dynamically generates a gallery of images on a webpage.
- loops through each item in the galleryItems array using the forEach() method, and for each item, it concatenates a string of HTML code that includes a link to the original image source, a thumbnail image preview, and a description
- when an image is clicked, using the basicLightbox.create() method, modal window opens that displays the clicked image at full size. The code also adds an event listener to the document that listens for the "Escape" key to be pressed, and if it is, it closes the modal window.

Task 2:
- imports an array from a separate JavaScript file
- iterates through the galleryItems array using forEach()
- creates gallery using SimpleLightbox
